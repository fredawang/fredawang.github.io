<h1 id="jQuery-appear">jQuery.appear</h1>
<p>This is a total revamp of original jquery.appear plugin hosted on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/">http://code.google.com/p/jquery-appear/</a></p>
<p>Check <a href="http://morr.github.com/appear.html">demo page</a>!</p>
<p>This plugin can be used to prevent unnecessary processeing for content that is hidden or is outside of the browser viewport.</p>
<p>It implements a custom <em>appear</em>/<em>disappear</em> events which are fired when an element became visible/invisible in the browser viewport.</p>
<pre><code>    <span class="variable">$(</span><span class="string">'someselector'</span>).appear(); <span class="regexp">//</span> <span class="constant">It</span> supports optinal hash with <span class="string">"force_process"</span> <span class="keyword">and</span> <span class="string">"interval"</span> keys. <span class="constant">Check</span> source code <span class="keyword">for</span> details.

    <span class="variable">$(</span><span class="string">'&lt;div&gt;test&lt;/div&gt;'</span>).appear(); <span class="regexp">//</span> <span class="constant">It</span> also supports raw <span class="constant">DOM</span> nodes wrapped <span class="keyword">in</span> jQuery.

    <span class="variable">$(</span><span class="string">'someselector'</span>).on(<span class="string">'appear'</span>, function(event, <span class="variable">$all_appeared_elements</span>) {
      <span class="regexp">//</span> this element is now inside browser viewport
    });
    <span class="variable">$(</span><span class="string">'someselector'</span>).on(<span class="string">'disappear'</span>, function(event, <span class="variable">$all_disappeared_elements</span>) {
      <span class="regexp">//</span> this element is now outside browser viewport
    });
</code></pre><p>If you want to fire <em>appear</em> event for elements which are close to vieport but are not visible yet, you may add data attributes <em>appear-top-offset</em> and <em>appear-left-offset</em> to DOM nodes.</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;div class=<span class="string">"postloader"</span> data-appear-top-offset=<span class="string">"600"</span>&gt;<span class="keyword">...</span>&lt;/div&gt; <span class="comment"># appear will be fired when an element is below browser viewport for 600 or less pixels</span>
</code></pre><p>Appear check can be forced by calling <em>$.force_appear()</em>. This is suitable in cases when page is in initial state (not scrolled and not resized) and when you want manually trigger appearance check.</p>
<p>Also this plugin provides custom jQuery filter for manual checking element appearance.</p>
<pre><code>    $(<span class="string">'someselector'</span>).<span class="keyword">is</span>(<span class="string">':appeared'</span>)
